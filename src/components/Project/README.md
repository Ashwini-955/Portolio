This folder contains the `Project` component used to showcase projects.

How to customize:
- Replace each project's `repo` and `live` properties in `Project.jsx` with your real links.
- Replace the `media-ghost` placeholder inside the `.card-media` with an `<img src={...} alt="..."/>` if you have project screenshots.
- Tweak colors and gradients in `Project.css` to match your theme.

The component is responsive and shows a single-column layout on small screens.
